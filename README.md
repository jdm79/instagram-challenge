# Makers Instagram Challenge

A TDD project aiming to replicate (some of) Instagram!

### Features

* Flash alerts for validation (e.g. if no image attached when attempting to create post)
* Basic image/caption posting using the Paperclip gem
* Some feature tests using the (now-deprecated) FactoryGirl gem as well as Capybara
* 

### Stack

* Ruby on Rails
* HTML (with ERB)
* Bootstrap and CSS
* RSpec and Capybara (for feature tests) 

Heavily influenced by [this tutorial](https://www.devwalks.com/lets-build-instagram-test-driven-with-ruby-on-rails-part-1/)

### How to get started

* clone the repo
* bundle install
* run rails s to start server, go to localhost:3000
